# Data Structure From Scratch Using C++
My Data Structures Implementation, This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures written from scratch. The goal is to understand their inner workings, optimize performance, and reinforce problem-solving skills.

📌 Features
✅ Implementations of essential data structures:

ArrayList
Linked List (Singly)
Stack using array
Stack using linked list
Balanced Parentheses
Queue using array
Queue using linked list
Binary Search Tree (BST)

✅ Written in C++.
✅ Commented code for easy understanding.
✅ Suitable for learning, practicing, and contributing.

Can be extended and improved in the future.

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/eslams3dawi/Data-Structure-From-Scratch-Using-C-Plus-Plus.git
2️⃣ Open the project in Visual Studio / VS Code.
3️⃣ Run and test each structure individually.

📚 Usage
Each data structure has its own class file with methods demonstrating core operations.
You can modify, extend, and optimize them as needed.

🤝 Contributions
Feel free to contribute, improve, or suggest new structures!
