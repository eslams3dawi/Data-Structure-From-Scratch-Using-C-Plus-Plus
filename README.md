# 🚀 Data Structures from Scratch Using C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** written from scratch in **C++**.  
The goal is to understand their inner workings, optimize performance, and reinforce problem-solving skills.

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ Implementations of essential data structures:  
- **ArrayList**  
- **Linked List (Singly)**  
- **Stack (Array-based & Linked List-based)**  
- **Queue (Array-based & Linked List-based)**  
- **Balanced Parentheses Checker**  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  

✅ **Written in C++**  
✅ **Commented code for easy understanding**  
✅ **Suitable for learning, practicing, and contributing**  

📌 _This project can be extended and improved in the future._

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Follow these steps to get started with the project:  

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```md
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eslams3dawi/Data-Structure-From-Scratch-Using-C-Plus-Plus.git

2️⃣ Open the project in Visual Studio / VS Code

3️⃣ Run and test each structure individually

##📚 Usage
Each data structure has its own class file with methods demonstrating core operations.
You can modify, extend, and optimize them as needed.

##🤝 Contributions
